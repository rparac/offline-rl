Given the task, assign a discrete progress score reward (1,2,3,4,5) for the robot in the video in the format: ANSWER: <score>
Rubric for end-of-episode progress (judge only the final state without time limits):
1 - No Success: Final state shows no goal-relevant change for the command.
2 - Minimal Progress: Final state shows a small but insufficient change toward the goal.
3 - Partial Completion: The final state shows good progress toward the goal but violates more than one requirement or a major requirement.
4 - Near Completion: Final state is correct in region and intent but misses a single minor requirement.
5 - Perfect Completion: Final state satisfies all requirements.

Task: 
You are a robot in a grid world which consits of a blue diamond gem, a yellow-grey pickaxe, a yellow magma texture, and a red open door. 
Your task is to get on top of the pickaxe object which will make it invisible.
